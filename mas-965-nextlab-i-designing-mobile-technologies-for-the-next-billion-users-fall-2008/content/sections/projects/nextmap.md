----------------------------------------

Every year, thousands of people in India are displaced by massive floods as a result of torrential rains during monsoon season. Lack of infrastructure during these times lead to significant delays in communication with relief workers and, as a result, aid delivery. NextMap is a mobile communication platform that supports bi- directional broadcasting and data collection. Unlike existing mobile systems that are proprietary or custom-developed, NextMap aims to create a general, open toolset that can be leveraged across various scenarios from disaster management to environmental conservation in remote locations.
